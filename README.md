# ðŸŸ£ Automated Question Generator & Summarizer ðŸŸ£ #

Examinations and Assessments are undergoing a tremendous revolution.The pattern of assessment is majorly shifting towards the objective based assessment
i.e. MCQ based , it is very hard to construct and it requires considerable amount of time for setting numerous questions on daily basis.
Thereâ€™s a growing need for a cost-effective and time efficient automated MCQ generation system.

In this technique we use AI powered tools based on Natural Language Processing. Automatically generating MCQs from any content using BERT. BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)- most powerful game-changing NLP algorithm by Google for real world task. It helps computers understand language a bit more like humans do. It is a pre-trained model open sourced by google which can be used to summarize text , extract keywords.
Wordnet approach (to get the sense of the word) is used to generate distractors. It is used to get the correct sense of the word given a sentence along with it.

## âœ… Web Functionalities ##

Frontend consists of Web interface in which user has to submit the content on which he/she has to generate Questions this content should be in a Plain Text/PDF/PPT format.
User can also search the Topic Tag on the provided search bar for which he/she has to generate questions. The program will then find the relevant information based on the tag from the internet and display to the user.
From the given content the processing is done and the keywords are generated, user can also select the keywords of his/her choice. If user finds some questions irrelevant he/she can discard or manipulate or change that particular question accordingly. The generated output can be saved into our database or can be exported as in Word (.docs) format, pdf format or Google forms and also a shareable link.

## âœ… Conclusion  ##

Automating MCQs is effective way to generate questions using AI powered tools which is time efficient, reduces human intervention and cost effective technique when compared to traditional form based way for generation of MCQs. This will not only help teachers to assess but also students who are preparing for competitive exams or any other exams for analyzing their understanding of the concepts.
